                <h2>Ride the Bus</h2>
                <p id="moretext">Phase 1:</p>
                <p id="moretext">Red or Black? </p>
                <p id="moretext">Dealer deals a card face-down to each player. Players guess if their card is red or black. Once a player has made their guess, the dealer flips the card over. If the player is correct, nothing happens. But if they’re wrong, they drink.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Higher or Lower?</p>
                <p id="moretext">Everyone holds on to their first card, the dealer deals another face-down card to each player. Players will have to guess if this card’s value is be higher or lower than the card they have in their hand. Again, correct guess, nothing happens, wrong guess, time to drink.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">In-Between or Outside?</p>
                <p id="moretext">Now, as the players have 2 cards in their hand, the dealer deals a third face-down card to everyone. Players now have to guess if the value of this card falls in-between the values of their 2 existing cards or not. You're right, nada. You're wrong, drink.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Guess The Suit.</p>
                <p id="moretext">Now all players have 3 cards, and the dealer deals 1 final face-down card to everyone. Players guess the exact suit of the face-down card. If the card is any of the 3 other suits, they must drink.</p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">Phase 2:</p>
                <p id="moretext">Construct a 5-row pyramid with 1 card at the top and 5 at the bottom.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Once the pyramid is done, the dealer begins flipping the cards over one at a time, starting with a card in the 5-card row and completing that row before moving up the pyramid. This is done until the card at the top of the pyramid is flipped.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Match the cards in your hand with the cards in the pyramid. After each card flip, players place a card in their hand on top of this flipped card if they have a card in hand with the same value. The goal is to get rid of all of the cards in hand by matching them with cards in the pyramid.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Assign drinks to others if you have a matching card. The number of drinks is based on the drink value associated with each row. 1st row 1 drink, 2nd row 2 drinks and so on. </p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">Phase 3:</p>
                <p id="moretext">Once all the cards in the pyramid have been flipped over, determine who in your group will be “riding the bus.” The bus rider is the player with the most cards in their hand remaining. Same number of cards in hand, the highest value card holder rides the bus. If tie for highest value, next highest value loses. If all cards are matched during the pyramid phase, the last player to match a card is the bus rider.</p>
                <p id="moretext" style="margin-top: 1%;">Once you know the bus rider, the dealer lays a face-down card in front of them. The rider makes a guess, red or black. If right, they keep the card and move on to "higher or lower". If wrong, they drink. The bus rider must successfully make it through all 4 rounds of the dealing part of the game without guessing incorrectly. If a guess is incorrect, start over at "red or black".</p>

                <h2>Howdy Governor</h2>
                <p id="moretext">Players sit in a circle and count to 21. Whoever lands on 21 makes a new rule (e.g., "clap on 5").</p>
                <p id="moretext">If someone forgets the rules, they drink. Start over after 21.</p>

                <h2>Medusa</h2>
                <p id="moretext">Players stand in a circle around a table with their heads down. On the count of three, everyone looks up at someone else. If two players make eye contact, they shout "Medusa!". The one who says it last, drinks.</p>

                <h2>Rose From Finland</h2>
                <p id="moretext">Each player makes a tie out of toilet paper. Prepare a punch bowl. The players sit around the table and the punch bowl is in the middle of the table. The appropriate amount of punch is ladled into a cup for each person.</p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">Now, let’s choose a dealer. The dealer deals cards and straffs. Straff, aka punishment: the dealer may give a player a straff, as he sees fit, of his own volition or to silence the screaming "Straff!"s from other players, e.g. if a player fucks around, doesn't drink their rations fast enough, behaves inappropriately, phone rings, a player tries to cheat or vomits.</p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">A good dealer also takes the straff himself. A good dealer will order a player out of the game if his health and well-being is at risk. A player does not have to sit at the table except on his own turn, but if a player is out of the game when his turn comes, he will drink a double when he comes back for the number of times his turn fell on him during his absence.</p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">How the game works: The dealer deals eight cards on the table around a punch bowl, as rose petals. Players are not allowed to look at the cards. The dealer deals a card to the player in turn. The player turns the card over and shows it to everyone. A clockwise count starts from the player in turn and continues for the number of cards shown by the number of eyes. The player on whom the count ends drinks. The number one (ace) goes to the player in turn. The counting is done aloud to set the mood, accompanied by a little foot drumming. If the card is normal, the person drinks one drink. If a face card, the person gets to decide who drinks. Tens are drunk in doubles. In addition, every tenth card to be drunk is drunk in doubles (10, 20, 30...). If the tenth card is a ten, the doubles are drunk as doubles. </p>
                <br id="moretext">
                <p id="moretext">Continue until the deck runs out. Then play the rose petals, which are all drunk in doubles. This time the players get to choose which petal to draw. The card is normally used to calculate the drinker's turn.</p>
